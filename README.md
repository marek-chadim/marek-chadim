# Hi, and thanks for visiting my profile! ðŸ‘‹

I am an economics student passionate about applied econometrics.

My undergraduate degree is from Charles University in Prague, and I am now studying in Stockholm. Feel free to view my projects and favorite resources (and appreciate the Latin sheepskin effect) below.
