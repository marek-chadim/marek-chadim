# Hi and thanks for visiting my profile! ðŸ‘‹ 

I am an economics student passionate about applied econometrics, ranging from reduced-form to structural evaluation, discrete choice, and causal machine learning. I focus on topics in labor economics, health economics, development economics, and the economics of education.
