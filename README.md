# Hi, and thanks for visiting my profile! ðŸ‘‹
I am a student at the Stockholm School of Economics, with an undergraduate degree from IES Charles University in Prague, and a research assistant at the IIES, Stockholm University. I study statistical tools and research designs that are useful for conducting high-quality empirical research on topics in applied microeconomics and related fields. My focus is on estimating causal effects with direct policy implications.
