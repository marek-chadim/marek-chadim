# Hi, and thanks for visiting my profile! ðŸ‘‹
I am student at the Stockholm School of Economics, and a research assistant at the Institute for International Economic Studies, focused on topics in applied econometrics. My 2023 undergraduate degree is from the IES Charles University in Prague (sheepskin effect?).
