# Hi, and thanks for visiting my profile! ðŸ‘‹
As an MSc student at the Stockholm School of Economics, with bachelor degree IES Charles University in Prague, and currently a research assistant at the IIES, Stockholm University, I focus on statistical tools and research designs. My aim is to conduct high-quality empirical research and estimate causal effects with direct policy implications on topics in applied microeconomics and related fields.
