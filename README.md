# Hi, and thanks for visiting my profile! ðŸ‘‹

I am an economics student passionate about applied econometrics. My undergraduate degree is from the IES Charles University in Prague, and I am now studying the MSc in Economics at the Stockholm School of Economics. Feel free to view my projects and favorite resources (and appreciate the Latin sheepskin effect) below.
