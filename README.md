# Hi, and thanks for visiting my profile! ðŸ‘‹
I am a student at the Stockholm School of Economics and a research assistant at the Institute for International Economic Studies, Stockholm University. My undergraduate degree is from IES Charles University in Prague. I study statistical tools and research designs that are useful for conducting high-quality empirical research on topics in applied microeconomics and related fields. My focus is on estimating causal effects with direct policy implications.
