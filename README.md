# Hi, and thanks for visiting my profile! ðŸ‘‹
As an MSc student at the Stockholm School of Economics, with a bachelorâ€™s degree from IES Charles University in Prague, and currently a research assistant at the IIES, Stockholm University. My focus is on econometrics and applied microeconomics. My focus is on complementing credible reduced-form methods with the modeling capabilities of structural approaches, and causal debiased machine learning techniques for inference in models using modern predictive tools. https://github.com/marek-chadim/econ
