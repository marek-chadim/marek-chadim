# Hi, and thanks for visiting my profile! ðŸ‘‹
I am an economics student at the Stockholm School of Economics, and a research assistant at the Institute for International Economic Studies, Stockholm University. In 2023, I received an undergraduate degree from the IES Charles University in Prague (sheepskin effect?).
